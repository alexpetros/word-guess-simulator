## Sources
The word list used here was generated by combining two lists of words, both of which retrieved from Peter Norvig's ngrams list. They are:

* [count_1w.txt](https://norvig.com/ngrams/count_1w.txt), the 1/3 most used words in the English language
* [enable1.txt](https://norvig.com/ngrams/enable1.txt), the ENABLE word list often used for word games.

You can read more about these on his site.

## Generating the Word List
The goal was basically to get a list of common, non-proper words that an English-speaker might reasonably be able to deduce for the game. The most-common words list does not distinguish by type of word at all, and the games list has lots of words that are presumably legal but not at all guessable. So I took the 30k most common words, and took all the words in that list that were also sgame-legal.

```
# Sort the frequency list by frequency, print the first field, get the top 30k, and sort alphabetically
sort -nr -k 2 count_1w.txt | awk '{ print $1 }' | head -n 30000 | sort > top-30k

# Sort the games-legal list alphabetically
sort enable1.txt > games-legal

# Get the lines (in this case, single words) they have in common
comm -1 -2 top-30k games-legal > words
```

For guessing 5 letter-words, that comes out to a dictionary of 2535 words:

```
$ awk 'length($0) == 5' words| wc -l
2535
```
